Hi there! My name is Vlad. I'm a business software developer: I create complex information systems and then explain in simple terms how they work.

My specialization is the 1C:Enterprise platform, with over ten years of experience and [expert](https://1c.ru/check-certificate/printcopy/620c93bd-caf8-11db-b9de-000e0c2f31ac/70322/c995e35d-10a2-11df-a6c6-001a6411168a) status. Additionally, I have [experienced](https://postgrespro.ru/education/cert/check?#752094d4-1ef5-4f74-b2ca-ef90b05cc937) in PostgreSQL and also write in Python and JavaScript.
 
I write and speak in Russian. By the way, this website has a [mirror](https://kostyanetsky.ru) in Russian.
 
Currently, I'm working on [FirstBIT ERP](https://firstbit.ae). It is a company management system (sales, purchasing, production, human resources, accounting, you know this stuff) designed for the United Arab Emirates.

I live in Tbilisi. Married, raising a daughter. Have a passion for walking and video games.
