For the last month I have been rewriting standard data exchange between FirstBit ERP and Bitrix for a client task. Co-workers doing the same on the Bitrix side prepared a huge mapping for this case: which field on the 1C side should be transferred to which Bitrix field (and vice versa).

They published this mapping as Google Docs tables, in the interface of which you can see users using any document at this moment — both logged in and anonymous. Anonymous ones traditionally are displaying as [animals](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494888?hl=en).

Colleagues generally prefer to work anonymously. As a result, I definetely used to feel like a Disney princess: you start working in the morning, and anonymous quokkas, penguins and chinchillas roll out from everywhere :-)
