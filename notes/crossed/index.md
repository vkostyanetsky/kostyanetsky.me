Making a password recover function via SMS for our customer portal. Got to the Twilio [documentation](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223133767-International-support-for-Alphanumeric-Sender-ID) related to [alphanumeric sender ID](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-alphanumeric-sender-id) support in different countries; this feature allows you to send messages so that the recipient sees not the sender's number but something meaningful (a company name, for example).

The feature is regulated differently everywhere: somewhere it just works, but somewhere registration is possible or even required.

Well, I'm taking a look:

🤔

- Portugal: yes
- Puerto Rico: no
- Qatar: yes (with registration)
- Reunion: yes
- Romania: yes (with registration) (but be afraid of Dracula)

I don’t know how else to explain this cemetery.

UPD: Found the answer. Grave crosses mean you have to pay $700 to register.

To be frank, I like the explanation about Dracula much more.
