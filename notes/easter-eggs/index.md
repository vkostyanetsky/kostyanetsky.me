A couple of Easter eggs hidden inside FirstBit ERP. They're tucked away for the developers: in the first case, users see just the form title and notification text, while in the second, they see the standard "waiting for connection" message.

I like to add little things like this from time to time — it helps to keep things fun, even when the task isn’t the most exciting or I’m just feeling tired. If you haven’t read Bystronovsky’s article "[Design Without Stress](https://collab.ldwg.ru/stressless-design)" I highly recommend it (I wouldn’t be able to put it any better myself).

Oh, and by the way, here’s another Easter egg! This one isn’t from our ERP system, but from the automated database update tool we’re building right now. Since it's for internal use, we can joke around with the user a bit :)
