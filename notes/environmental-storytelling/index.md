I like to notice things in the world around me that clearly have a story behind them. In video games, this is called “environmental storytelling”: they don’t tell you the story directly, but if you look around, you can guess which gun was hanging on the wall and who fired from it.

For example, I recently celebrated the company's 10th anniversary with colleagues at a local golf club. Balls had to be sent flying from the second floor; there are no railings for obvious reasons, but a net is stretched in case someone loses their balance.

There are warnings on the walls: jump into the net of your own free will and pay <abbr title="About two hundred thousand rubles at this moment.">ten thousand dirhams</abbr>. Recording this heroic leap of faith on camera is fine as well, just prepare five thousand more.

Another example: once flew to Turkey to rest and decided, just in case, to look through the rules of the airline (what can be taken on board, what can not). Among the list of items prohibited from being carried on board, I found “steel spear” and “steel flail” 😬

People have interesting jobs, I may say! I even became envious for a second.

UPD: Another great [example](soundproof.jpeg) from somewhere on the Internet.
