Released a new [version](https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/Fastimer/releases/tag/v1.3.1) of my console timer for [intermittent fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting). I wrote this app about a year ago, when I was once again upset by the [Zero](https://www.zerolongevity.com/) application for Android: some very primitive functions (like viewing a specific interval) did not work. Oh my gosh, guys, you had one job!

The main difference between 1.3.1 and 1.2.3 is that the console menu has been cut to hell in favor of the good old arguments and options. The menu concept looks convenient only if an application has few features. However, as soon as you take a step forward, the need to answer a list of questions each time you need something starts to irritate you.
