I needed to quickly generate some images for a pet project. I grabbed the first tool at hand — [WaifuDiffusion](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/waifu-diffusion) (a clone of [StableDiffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium), but trained specifically on anime and manga).

Prompt: 

> A dimly lit, empty classroom with faintly visible music notes on the chalkboard. A young woman with long blue hair and blue eyes, is standing behind the teacher's desk, packing her things into a small handbag. She looks tired and worried.

Result:

It seems like a great opportunity to talk about how far neural networks have come! The model instantly got the idea and decided to introduce into the scene... Hmm... A wise bearded man? Or perhaps it was suggesting that I should learn to appreciate unexpected surprises more?

I think WaifuDiffusion just wanted to brighten my mood. They say laughter extends life. In any case, I consider the first generation a success! But it definitely needs some calibration :)
