Some time ago, I was setting up [Swagger](https://swagger.io) for the internal API. While I was fiddling around, it became clear that some functionality did not need to be included in the documentation. I was looking for a way to do this without crutches and came across a funny [question](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-couchbase/issues/10) on GitHub.

What's funny, you ask? Well, I involuntarily remembered [Mista](https://forum.mista.ru). Among 1C developers, this is synonymous with the word “toxicity”: if you ask anything there, you get a bucket of slop by the collar instead of an answer. Here, of course, everything is not so neglected, but holy crap! These persistent guys who referring to the 14-page manual made me laugh a lot.

One thing is good: by the end of the thread, there appeared a brave rebel who simply named the required parameter for the decorator.

Not all heroes wear capes, I would say.
