Yesterday, I decided to take a break from work and go for a good run. I headed to the local park and did a few laps. Sitting there catching my breath, I grabbed my phone to switch the track, and there it was — a congratulations from my fitness tracker.

So much for taking a break. The platform is watching you, %username%!

P.S. But hey, now I’ve got a custom badge with the platform's logo. Gotta wear it with pride!
