Following my [first](/notes/obsidian-fastimer/) plugin for Obsidian, I released [the second one](https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/ObsidianFoodiary) a couple of weeks ago. Counts calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in food. It helps not to overeat out of nowhere — it’s rather difficult to judge by eye how much you’ve eaten today and whether you can afford that donut.

In short, a useful thing if you:

1. Fatty (like me)
2. Want to stop being fatty (like me)
3. You take notes in Obsidian (like me) 🙂

In fact, there is a lot of software for this task. I tried some of them but was dissatisfied: it either has terrible design, is bugged, or is constantly trying to sell me a monthly subscription. In short, it's more annoying than helpful. I wanted something native, built into the usual routine; so, if routine settles in Obsidian, then the solution seems to suggest itself.

You can install the plugin directly from the program — the developers have already approved it. Otherwise, everything is simple: you write in a daily note what you ate and how much it weighed, and you receive a simple table sorted by calories with numbers by proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

There are examples in the repository at the link above.
