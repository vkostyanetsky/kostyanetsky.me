I made another [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin, this time for [daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes). Draws a nice report: what tasks I worked on, what I did, and how much time I spent. I tried to describe how it works in the [repository](https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/ObsidianTimesheet); will be glad to receive any feedback!

Funny thing: for the examples in the README, I used issues like FBI-1, FBI-2, and so on. This is not a reference to the X-Files or Twin Peaks — it's just the first prefix that came to mind. The fact is that our internal project for the development of FirstBit ERP is called First Bit Internal, abbreviated as FBI :) The main pool of tasks we are working on is created and tracked in it.

We’re already used to it, but our colleagues outside the company always find our screenshots from JIRA or SonarQube amusing.
