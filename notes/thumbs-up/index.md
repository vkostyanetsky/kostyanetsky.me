A knock at the door. I open it, and there are two bright, twenty-something girls standing there. Flashing huge smiles at me, they start talking a mile a minute.

The Georgian language is beautiful, but I haven’t gotten around to learning it yet. I sigh and suggest we switch to English or Russian.

The girls frown a little. Then one of them digs into her bag, pulls out a flyer, points to it, gives me a thumbs up like, “Cool stuff!” — and hands it to me. 

Then they laugh and run off.

Take that, language barrier!
