I'm out for a walk in the evening, and behind me there's some mom and her little kid — about five years old, I guess. I don't see them, I just hear them talking. The mom is explaining university to the kid: that you have to get in, study, there will be exams and all that.

The boy is quiet for a bit, then says sadly:

— I thought there was only school, but it turns out there are more difficulties too...
