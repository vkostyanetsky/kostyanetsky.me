Hi there! My name is Vlad. I'm a business software developer based in Kemerovo, Russia. I specialize in [1C:Enterprise](https://1c.com) and experiment with everything else. A lot.

I also have a passion for cycling and video games.

Currently I work for [FirstBIT Technologies](https://firstbit.ae). Our main project is <nobr>[FirstBIT ERP](https://firstbit.ae/products/erp-dubai/financial_management/)</nobr> — it is a company management system designed for United Arab Emirates.
