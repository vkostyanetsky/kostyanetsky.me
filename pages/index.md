Hi there! My name is Vlad. I'm a business software developer specializing in [1C:Enterprise platform](https://1c-dn.com/) and experimenting with everything else. A lot.

Currently, I'm working on [FirstBIT ERP](https://firstbit.ae). It is a company management system (sales, purchasing, production, human resources, accounting, you know this stuff) designed for the United Arab Emirates.

I also secretly have a passion for cycling and video games.
