The further it goes, the more difficult it becomes to write notes. Even as irregularly as I used to do it. Programming? Household stuff? Anything else? Whatever I decide to write about, everything ends up seeming stupid, unnecessary, and inappropriate.

However, many topics that were previously taken seriously, but not really close — now literally acquired form, sound, taste, and color. For example, the tweet at the beginning of this note: before current events it was sad and gloomy, but now, when it's time to look into those eyes, it feels entirely different.

Peace for everyone.
