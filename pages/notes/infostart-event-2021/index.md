Last week I visited Moscow for [Infostart Event 2021](https://event.infostart.ru/2021_msk/):

- Listen to numbers of interesting reports — check;
- Meet a few cool people in real life — check;
- Chat with friends — check!

As a result, I suddenly felt rested despite the flights, stress, and fuss. I think it's because I'm working remotely, so it was really cool to look at so many colleagues in real life (not as a stream of electrons, I mean).

In order not to <s>get up</s> to fly twice, I passed the [first test](https://postgrespro.ru/education/exam/DBA1-10) for PostgreSQL administration in the PostgresPro office. There are three more tests ahead, and the final one does not exist at all yet — but the walking one will master the road, I guess.
