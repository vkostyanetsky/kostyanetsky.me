![A chat with my daughter](telegram.png)

On the screenshot above my little one is just letting me know where she is: walking down the street, at the school, at a playground. It's not her fault that I have a sort of nerd view: when I look at this chat I see nothing but code on Gherkin, which is just a bit broken. A little patch here and there and it will be fine :-)

    And I exit home
    Then I enter school
    And I exit school
    Then I gonna swing

We use Gherkin to write our autotests for [Vanessa Automation](https://github.com/Pr-Mex/vanessa-automation). I can't say I've made very many of them, especially in comparison with some of my colleagues... Well, it seems like I've made them enough to twist the reality a few.
