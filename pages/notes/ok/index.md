Oh, shoot! Just watched the video and realized that I got used to writing OK when asked “how do you feel today”. Like, everything is normal with me, I'm alive and doing well, nothing affects my work, etc.

Now I'm afraid to guess what colleagues thought about me. I hope they also did not know that okay in the answer to such a question does not mean okay at all :-)
