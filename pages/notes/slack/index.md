Slack, of course, is a thing to scold. For being slow, for having bugs, for notifications. But I just love his stubs in case there are no new messages.

Look at this cuteness:

![All done. The future is yours.](all-done.png)

Why do we need psychotherapists at all?

![You're up to date. Go forth and do great things.](up-to-date.png)

Or this:

![You're all read. Here is a tractor.](here-is-tractor.png)

Geez-Louise, Slack, hold on. You're not the first who advices this, believe me.
