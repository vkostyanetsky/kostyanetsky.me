You're sliding down the side of a mountain and trying to feel an equilibrium point, for the hundredth time. However, your nagging back is the only thing you're able to feel, and the Vaas speech from Far Cry 3 isn't going out of your mind.

> Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... Same fucking thing... Over and over again expecting... Shit to change... That. Is. Crazy.
>*― Vaas Montenegro, Far Cry 3*

Surprisingly, you're certainly satisfied with the trip when it's done.

There's some kind of magic in it.
